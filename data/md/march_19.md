## üèõÔ∏è UNESCO heritage site of the day

> *Villa Romana del Casale*, Italy

<p>Roman exploitation of the countryside is symbolized by the Villa Romana del Casale (in Sicily), the centre of the large estate upon which the rural economy of the Western Empire was based. The villa is one of the most luxurious of its kind. It is especially noteworthy for the richness and quality of the mosaics which decorate almost every room; they are the finest mosaics <em>in situ</em> anywhere in the Roman world.</p>
