## 🏛️ UNESCO heritage site of the day

> *Migratory Bird Sanctuaries along the Coast of Yellow Sea-Bohai Gulf of China (Phase I)*, China

<p>The property features an intertidal mudflat system considered to be the largest in the world. These mudflats, as well as marshes and shoals, are exceptionally productive and serve as growth areas for many species of fish and crustaceans. The intertidal areas of the Yellow Sea/Gulf of Bohai are of global importance for the gathering of many migratory bird species that use the East Asian-Australasian flyway. Large gatherings of birds, including some of the world's most endangered species, depend on the coastline as a stopover to moult, rest, winter or nest.</p>
