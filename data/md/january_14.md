## 🏛️ UNESCO heritage site of the day

> *Royal Building of <i>Mafra</i> – Palace, Basilica, Convent, <i>Cerco</i> Garden and Hunting Park (<i>Tapada</i>)*, Portugal

Located 30 km northwest of Lisbon, the property was conceived by King João V in 1711 as a tangible representation of his conception of the monarchy and the State. This imposing quadrangular building houses the king’s and queen's palaces, the royal chapel, shaped like a Roman baroque basilica, a Franciscan monastery and a library containing 36,000 volumes. The complex is completed by the <em>Cerco</em> garden, with its geometric layout, and the royal hunting park (<em>Tapada</em>). The Royal <em>Mafra</em> Building is one of the most remarkable works undertaken by King João V, which illustrates the power and reach of the Portuguese Empire. João V adopted Roman and Italian baroque architectural and artistic models and commissioned works of art that make <em>Mafra</em> an exceptional example of Italian Baroque.
