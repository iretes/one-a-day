## 🏛️ UNESCO heritage site of the day

> *Megalithic Jar Sites in Xiengkhuang – Plain of Jars*, Lao People's Democratic Republic

<p>The Plain of Jars, located on a plateau in central Laos, gets its name from more than 2,100 tubular-shaped megalithic stone jars used for funerary practices in the Iron Age. This serial property of 15 components contains large carved stone jars, stone discs, secondary burials, tombstones, quarries and funerary objects dating from 500 BCE to 500 CE. The jars and associated elements are the most prominent evidence of the Iron Age civilization that made and used them until it disappeared, around 500 CE.</p>
