## 🏛️ UNESCO heritage site of the day

> *The Sassi and the Park of the Rupestrian Churches of Matera*, Italy

<p>This is the most outstanding, intact example of a troglodyte settlement in the Mediterranean region, perfectly adapted to its terrain and ecosystem. The first inhabited zone dates from the Palaeolithic, while later settlements illustrate a number of significant stages in human history. Matera is in the southern region of Basilicata.</p>
