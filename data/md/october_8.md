## üèõÔ∏è UNESCO heritage site of the day

> *Lednice-Valtice Cultural Landscape*, Czechia

<p>Between the 17th and 20th centuries, the ruling dukes of Liechtenstein transformed their domains in southern Moravia into a striking landscape. It married Baroque architecture (mainly the work of Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach) and the classical and neo-Gothic style of the castles of Lednice and Valtice with countryside fashioned according to English romantic principles of landscape architecture. At 200 km<sup>2</sup> , it is one of the largest artificial landscapes in Europe.</p>
