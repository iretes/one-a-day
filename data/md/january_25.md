## üèõÔ∏è UNESCO heritage site of the day

> *Wooden <em>Tserkvas</em> of the Carpathian Region in Poland and Ukraine*, Poland,Ukraine

<p>Situated in the eastern fringe of Central Europe, the transnational property numbers a selection of sixteen&nbsp;<em>tserkvas&nbsp;</em>(churches). They were built of horizontal wooden logs between the 16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;centuries by communities of Orthodox and Greek Catholic faiths. The&nbsp;<em>tserkvas</em>&nbsp;bear testimony to a distinct building tradition rooted in Orthodox ecclesiastic design interwoven with elements of local tradition, and symbolic references to their communities&rsquo; cosmogony.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;<em>tserkva</em><em>s&nbsp;</em>are built on a tri-partite plan surmounted by open quadrilateral or octagonal domes and cupolas. Integral to <em>tserkvas</em> are iconostasis screens, interior polychrome decorations, and other historic furnishings. Important elements of some <em>tserkvas</em> include&nbsp;wooden bell towers, churchyards, gatehouses and graveyards.</p>
