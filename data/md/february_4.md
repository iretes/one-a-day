> *Bahá’i Holy Places in Haifa and the Western Galilee*, Israel

<p>The Bah&aacute;&rsquo;i Holy Places in Haifa and Western Galilee are inscribed for their profound spiritual meaning and the testimony they bear to the strong tradition of pilgrimage in the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;i faith. The property includes the two most holy places in the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; religion associated with the founders, the Shrine of Bah&aacute;&rsquo;u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h in Acre and the Shrine of the B&aacute;b in Haifa, together with their surrounding gardens, associated buildings and monuments. These two shrines are part of a larger complex of buildings, monuments and sites at seven distinct locations in Haifa and Western Galilee that are visited as part of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;i pilgrimage.</p>
