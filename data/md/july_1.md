## 🏛️ UNESCO heritage site of the day

> *Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor*, Montenegro

<p>In the Middle Ages, this natural harbour on the Adriatic coast in Montenegro was an important artistic and commercial centre with its own famous schools of masonry and iconography. A large number of the monuments (including four Romanesque churches and the town walls) were seriously damaged by the 1979 earthquake but the town has been restored, largely with UNESCO’s help.</p>
