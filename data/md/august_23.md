## 🏛️ UNESCO heritage site of the day

> *Historic Quarter of the City of Colonia del Sacramento*, Uruguay

<p>Founded by the Portuguese in 1680 on the Río de la Plata, the city was of strategic importance in resisting the Spanish. After being disputed for a century, it was finally lost by its founders. The well-preserved urban landscape illustrates the successful fusion of the Portuguese, Spanish and post-colonial styles.</p>

## 💭 Philosophical concept of the day

> *[Thumos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumos)*

## 🗣️ Saying of the day

> *As white as snow*

Pure white. What better to symbolise whiteness than snow? Not only the intensity of colour on a bright winter's day, but also the purity of untrodden snow is summoned up by the simile. Shakespeare used this association to good effect in as pure as the driven snow. 

## 🏳️‍🌈 International day
