## 🏛️ UNESCO heritage site of the day

> *Precolumbian Chiefdom Settlements with Stone Spheres of the Diquís*, Costa Rica

<p>The property includes four archaeological sites located in the Diquís Delta in southern Costa Rica, which are considered unique examples of the complex social, economic and political systems of the period AD 500–1500. They contain artificial mounds, paved areas, burial sites and, most significantly, a collection of stone spheres, between 0.7 m and 2.57 m in diameter, whose meaning, use and production remain largely a mystery. The spheres are distinctive for their perfection, number, size and density, and placement in original locations. Their preservation from the looting that befell the vast majority of archaeological sites in Costa Rica has been attributed to the thick layers of sediment that kept them buried for centuries.</p>

## 🧑‍🔬 Scientific discovery of the day

> *499: Historians speculate that Aryabhata may have used an underlying heliocentric model for his astronomical calculations, which would make it the first computational heliocentric model in history (as opposed to Aristarchus's model in form). This claim is based on his description of the planetary period about the Sun (śīghrocca), but has been met with criticism.*
