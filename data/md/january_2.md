## 🏛️ UNESCO heritage site of the day

> *Historic Quarter of the Seaport City of Valparaíso*, Chile

<p>The colonial city of Valpara&iacute;so presents an excellent example of late 19th-century urban and architectural development in Latin America. In its natural amphitheatre-like setting, the city is characterized by a vernacular urban fabric adapted to the hillsides that are dotted with a great variety of church spires. It contrasts with the geometrical layout utilized in the plain. The city has well preserved its interesting early industrial infrastructures, such as the numerous &lsquo;elevators&rsquo; on the steep hillsides.</p>
